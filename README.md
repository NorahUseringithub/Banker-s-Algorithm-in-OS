# Banker’s algorithm
Banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue [1].

Here I implemented Banker's algorithm from scratch by using C++ language.
